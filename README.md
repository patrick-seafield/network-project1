# chatserve and chatclient

## chatserve

To run:

    cd chatserve
    ./chatserve.py PORT

## chatclient

To compile and run:

    cd chatclient
    make
    ./chatclient HOST PORT


# EXTRA CREDIT

* detail3

To run both the client and server in "extra credit" mode, append `--extra-credit` 
to both the server and client. (_Remember: both!_)

    ./chatserve.py PORT --extra-credit
    ./chatclient HOST PORT --extra-credit
